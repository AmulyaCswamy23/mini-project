Multimodal approach to pneumonia detection
I have attached the symptoms dataset you can download the xray dataset in kaggle by just searching pneumonia xray images
STEP-1
run the jupyter notebook with correct paths to the xray dataset then use streamlit run to run the python file then if the paths are correct the interface will appear where you can log symptoms and xray images.
